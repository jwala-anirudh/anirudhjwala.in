          Hey there! I'm a software engineer with a knack for building
          efficient, intuitive digital experiences and a passion for turning
          complex challenges into elegant solutions. With nearly four years of
          hands-on experience, I’ve had the privilege of working on projects
          that make a real difference. At IRIS Software Group, I’m part of the
          team shaping IRIS Elements, a cloud-based platform that’s simplifying
          life for accountants everywhere. From building AML dashboards for
          secure client assessments to crafting a reusable signup flow that
          reduced onboarding drop-offs by 60%, I’m all about creating solutions
          that work, scale, and delight.
        </p>

          <>
            <p className='text-base text-justify mb-2'>
              Before IRIS, I dove deep into the world of finance tech at
              Capgemini, collaborating with DBS Bank to develop an Anti-Money
              Laundering system that helped analysts detect and track suspicious
              activities. I’m proud of leading the charge to streamline
              multi-regional codebases and building custom CI/CD pipelines that
              brought real efficiency to our workflows. Each project has honed
              my skills and broadened my perspective on what tech can do.
            </p>
            <p className='text-base text-justify mb-2'>
              Beyond the 9-to-5, you’ll find me contributing to open-source
              projects, sharing my experiences through blogs, and continually
              tinkering with new tech. Whether I’m mastering API integrations or
              crafting visualizations, I’m constantly learning, exploring, and
              pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.
